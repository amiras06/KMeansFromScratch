- What problem does it address?

The K-means algorithm tackles the problem of partitioning a dataset into k groups (or clusters) based on the data's characteristics. The goal is to minimize intra-cluster variance and maximize inter-cluster variance, meaning that data within the same cluster should be as similar as possible, while data in different clusters should be distinct.

- What are the objectives?

* **Primary Objective:** Develop an implementation of the K-means algorithm that approaches the performance of existing versions.

* **Intermediate Objectives:**
  * **Study and Analysis:** Understand how the K-means algorithm works and analyze existing implementations to identify the keys to their effectiveness.
  * **Design:** Define the specifications for our implementation, including the choice of centroid initialization method.
  * **Development:** Code a first version of the algorithm, integrating the chosen initialization method and ensuring basic functionality.
  * **Optimization:** Identify opportunities for improvement based on tests and optimize the code to enhance performance.

* **Additional Objectives:**  
  After achieving performance comparable to the basic implementation, explore and implement variants of the K-means algorithm as well as more advanced optimizations to further improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of our algorithm.

- Testability:

The testability of the project will be based on performance comparisons using standard datasets to evaluate and compare the clustering results between our implementation and existing ones.

- Why is this not just a collage of APIs?

Our project goes beyond simply using existing APIs for several reasons:

* **In-depth Understanding:** We build the algorithm from scratch, which requires a deep understanding of its internal workings.
* **Customization:** We have the freedom to modify and optimize the algorithm according to our needs, which is not possible with a standard API.

In short, our project aims to deepen our understanding of the K-means algorithm and explore optimization avenues, while developing skills in programming and data analysis.
